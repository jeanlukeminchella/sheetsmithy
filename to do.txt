 - action entries could just be "actions" but this would take a lot of renaming!
 - sort Items out
 - consolidate item class, ccc function file ect
 - handle spell commands that dont match, let users input?
 - more backgroundds obviously
 - sort out the ranger feats (?)
 - cause an issue when we have 2h weapon and a shield
 - print the buildlog?
 - race doc needs renaming to species and sorting out, lots of spagetti code ect
 - feat file needs streamlining a lot, checking for duplicates ect. 
 - dig out all the randomisation - no, seed it properly
 - finish the javascript - inventory is sent in post request even if not selected
 - make spellcasting block should use addEntry  
 - validate boolean in global functions - defend against strings that say "false"? as they will interpret as true? 
 - bonus gold?
 - javascript: dont send empty values
