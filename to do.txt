 - action entries could just be "actions" but this would take a lot of renaming!

  - validate string, string list
  - dictionary even? thats done in character creation choices. get rid of the separate file then :)
    - consolidate item class, ccc function file ect
  
  - handle spell commands that dont match, let users input?
  

   - more backgroundds obviously
   - sort out the ranger feats

    - cause an issue when we have 2h weapon and a shield

  - race doc needs renaming to species and sorting out, lots of spagetti code ect
